        <h4> Bio</h4>
        <p>
  Headed in the direction of genius at political leadership, he was the 26th president of America. He brought new excitement and power to the Presidency, as he vigorously led Congress and the American public toward progressive reforms and a strong foreign policy. His conservationism and willingness to take on big business are examples of why he is considered to be one of the influential presidents in Americaâ€™s history.
